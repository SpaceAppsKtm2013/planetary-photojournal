planetary-photojournal
======================

The majority of the work on this project was the iPhone application. In addition to this, we've also written a crawler using crawler4j + jsoup.

To get the data, we provided the gallery URLs at http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov as seeds and let the crawler run, extracting what we needed.

We also wrote a simple PHP frontend which is the least secure thing you can imagine, but it does get the job done. Anyone is welcome to improve upon it.
